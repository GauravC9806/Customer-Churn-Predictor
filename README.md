# Customer-Churn-Predictor
This project focuses on predicting whether a telecom customer is likely to discontinue services (churn). By analyzing customer behavior, usage patterns, billing details, and service attributes, the model identifies high-risk customers before they leave.
📡 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

Predicting whether a telecom customer will discontinue services using machine learning.

📘 Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for telecom companies. This project builds a machine learning model capable of identifying customers who are likely to leave based on behavior, service usage, billing patterns, and subscription details.
The goal is to help businesses reduce churn, improve retention, and optimize customer experience.

🎯 Objectives

Predict whether a customer will churn (Yes/No).

Understand the key factors influencing churn.

Build interpretable ML models for business decision-making.

Provide insights to support targeted retention strategies.

🧠 Key Challenges

Mixed data types: categorical + numerical features.

Missing values & inconsistencies: duplicates, incomplete fields.

Feature engineering: identifying strong churn indicators.

Class imbalance: churn cases usually make up a small portion.

🔍 Key Insights

Major churn indicators typically include:

High monthly charges

Low tenure (new customers churn faster)

Network reliability issues

Frequent service complaints

Month-to-month contracts

Payment method (e.g., electronic check = higher churn)
